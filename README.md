### Hi, I'm Mikio ðŸ‘‹

I am a clinical data manager working at Stanford University School of Medicine and an aspiring data scientist! I earned my degree in Biological Sciences from UCSB (Class of 2019). Ever since I started working as a clinical data manager at Stanford, my interest in coding grew more and more. On the job, I mainly use Puython to automate and solve problems. I'm also a huge basketball fan, so I like to analyze data from the NBA and I always love a great sports data visualization. Woul love to connect and collaborate with other data scientists and experimental scientists who are interested in how coding and data science can help them advance their work!
