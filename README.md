### Hi, I'm Mikio ðŸ‘‹

I am a life science researcher/clinical data manager by training. While working as a clinical data manager at Stanford University School of Medicine, I got more and more interested in coding, especially in Python, which I used to automate and solve problems on the job. I'm also a huge basketball fan, so I like to analyze data from the NBA and I always love a great sports data visualization. Would love to connect and collaborate with other data scientists and experimental scientists who are interested in how coding and data science can help them advance their research.
