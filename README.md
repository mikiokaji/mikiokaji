### Hi, I'm Mikio ðŸ‘‹

I am a clinical data specialist by training who now is an aspiring data scientist. Ever since I started working at Stanford University School of Medicine, I got more interested in coding, especially in Python, which I used to automate and solve problems on the job. I'm also a huge basketball fan, so I like to analyze data from the NBA and I always love a great sports data visualization. Would love to connect and collaborate with other data scientists and experimental scientists who are interested in how coding and data science can help them advance their work.
